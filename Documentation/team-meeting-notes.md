    - Prioritized the health projects because of our preference to work with a 4th member
    - Wanted to be able to branch out on different technologies / areas of development
      -Patrick wanted to be able to learn more backend!
- Discussed preferred meeting times and locations for both the TA weekly meetings and to begin work on assignment 1
- Completed primer for FIHR and took notes on it for future reference
    - Learned that back-end development will likely center around the conversion of FHIR Questionnaire data into forms, and then converting the answers into QuestionnaireResponse format
    - We noticed that because of the type of work weâ€™re doing, we will need to validate our solutions more.
