# Dream Team's Industry Partner Meeting Notes

## Industry partner
Our industry partner is Alex

### Sept 30
 - Met async with the industry partner for our project and had him look over our milestones for the project to verify that it is both fair and realistic within the given time frame
     - He agreed that we set out a good plan for the rest of the semester and gave good tips for some of the stuff we wrote
     - Concluded that we will associate questionnaireResponses to hardcoded patients for now
     - He approved of our questionnaire pagination
     	- We will query a set of 10 questionnaires amd allow people to choose one or select a new set of 10 questionnaires which will reduce server stress and app load times
     - Discussed external tools that currently exist and whether our project is really worth the effort if existing tools already do what we want to build
     	- tools:
     		- [https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/](https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/)
     		- [http://smartqedit4.azurewebsites.net/Questionnaire](http://smartqedit4.azurewebsites.net/Questionnaire)
     	- Industry partner confirmed that tools do exist and do something similar but not fully as well as additional scope being a posibility if our project scope is too small if we use these tools
